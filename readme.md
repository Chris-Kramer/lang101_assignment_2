# Assignment 2 - String processing with Python

Using a text corpus found on the cds-language GitHub repo or a corpus of your own found on a site such as Kaggle, write a Python script that calculates collocates for a specific keyword.

- The script should take a directory of text files, a keyword, and a window size (number of words) as input parameters, and an output file called out/{filename}.csv
- These parameters can be defined in the script itself
- Find out how often each word collocates with the target across the corpus
- Use this to calculate mutual information between the target word and all collocates across the corpus
- Save result as a single file consisting of four columns: collocate, raw_frequency, MI

## Method
This script uses simple string processing techniques to find collocates and calculating their MI value. The MI (mutual information) value is a statistical evaluation of how often a collocate and the target word appear individually and how often both words appear together in a corpus.  

## How to run
This should work on both Linux, Mac, and Windows. However, if you are running on a
local windows machine, you should run it from a bash emulator such as git bash.  

**Step 1: Clone repo**
- open terminal
- Navigate to destination for repo
- type the following command:  
```console
git clone https://github.com/Chris-Kramer/lang101_assignment_2.git
```  
**Step 2 navigate to assignment folder**
- Navigate to _lang101_assignment_2_:  
```console
cd lang101_assignment_2
```   
**Step 3 run bash script**
- Run the bash script _run_assignment-2-christoffer.sh_:  
```console
bash run_assignment-2-christoffer.sh
```
The bash script will create a virtual environment, upgrade pip and run the python script.  
The script will after a couple of minutes start printning out words, their frequency and the MI value to the terminal. 
**_since the script might take a while to finish, you can stop it manually by pressing ctrl c, the output-file will still be available._**  

### Running on windows without a bash emulator  
If you're running on a local Windows machine, and don't have a bash emulator, you must set up a virtual environment, activate it, and then run the python script manually from the src folder. All packages in the script are part of pythonâ€™s standard library, so no need to install dependencies.  

## Output
The output is a csv-file with collocates and their MI value. It is located in the folder "output".  

## Parameters
The script takes the following parameters:  
- `--keyword` The target word you want to find collocates with.  
    - Default: "bald"  
- `--window_size` The size of the window for the KWIC lines, the size indicates how many words on each side of the target word the window should contain.  
    - Default: 5  
- `--corpus` The name of a corpus. The corpus must be a folder with txt files and it must be located witihn the "data" folder. Subfolders and non-txt files will not be included in the MI calculations.  
    - Default: "100_english_novels"  
- `--output` Filename for the output csv-file, which will be located in the folder "output".  
    - Default: "output.csv"  

### Example:  
_With bash script_  
```console
bash run_assignment-2-christoffer.sh --keyword single --window_size 7 --output single_collocates.csv
```  
_Without bash scrip_  
```console
python assignment-2-christoffer.sh --keyword single --window_size 7 --output single_collocates.csv
```
